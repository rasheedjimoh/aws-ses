# Setting up Email and SMS Sending System with AWS

# Introduction

In today's digital age, effective communication is crucial for businesses and individuals alike. Whether it's sending notifications, alerts, or updates, having a reliable system in place to send emails and SMS messages can streamline operations and enhance user engagement. In this portfolio, we explore the process of setting up an email and SMS sending system using Amazon Web Services (AWS). By leveraging AWS services such as IAM, SES, Lambda, and SNS, we establish a robust communication infrastructure that enables seamless message delivery across various channels.

## Why We Need It

The ability to send emails and SMS messages programmatically offers numerous benefits in terms of communication efficiency and user engagement. For businesses, it allows for timely notifications, updates, and alerts to customers, employees, and stakeholders. For individuals, it facilitates personalized communication and reminders. By automating the sending process through AWS services, we can ensure reliability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness, ultimately improving communication effectiveness and enhancing user experience.

## Technology Stack:

1. **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management):** IAM enables the management of user access to AWS services and resources securely. By creating roles within IAM, we can define the permissions necessary for Lambda functions to interact with other AWS services such as SNS and SES.

2. **AWS SES (Simple Email Service):** SES is a cloud-based email sending service provided by AWS. It allows for the sending and receiving of emails at scale, with features such as email authentication, content filtering, and delivery monitoring. By creating identities and verifying sender and recipient email addresses within SES, we ensure secure and reliable email delivery.

3. **AWS Lambda:** Lambda is a serverless computing service offered by AWS. It allows for the execution of code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers. By creating Lambda functions, we can execute code to send emails and SMS messages using the AWS SDK (boto3) and integrate with other AWS services.

4. **AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service):** SNS is a fully managed messaging service provided by AWS. It enables the sending of notifications to distributed systems and individuals through various communication channels, including email, SMS, and mobile push notifications. By configuring SNS topics and subscriptions, we can route messages from Lambda functions to desired endpoints, such as email addresses and phone numbers.

**Procedure:**

1. **Create IAM Role:** Go to IAM, select Roles, and create a role for Lambda functions with permissions to send emails and SMS messages using SNS, SES, and Step Functions.

2. **Configure SES Identity:** Create an identity in SES for email sending and verify both sender and recipient email addresses to ensure email delivery.

3. **Develop Lambda Function:** Create a Lambda function named "email.py" using Python 3.9, import the boto3 library, and define the lambda_handler function to send emails and SMS messages.

4. **Deploy and Test Function:** Deploy the Lambda function and test it to verify that emails and SMS messages are sent successfully.

5. **Confirmation:** Confirm that the Lambda function is working as expected by checking for successful message delivery to specified recipients.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, the setup of an email and SMS sending system using AWS services offers significant advantages in terms of communication efficiency, scalability, and reliability. By leveraging IAM, SES, Lambda, and SNS, we establish a robust communication infrastructure that enables seamless message delivery across various channels. This portfolio demonstrates the importance of leveraging cloud-based solutions for effective communication, ultimately enhancing user engagement and operational efficiency.
